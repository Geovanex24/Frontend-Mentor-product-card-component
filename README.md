## Overview

A product preview card component is a UI element used in e-commerce websites to provide users with a quick overview of a product's key features, such as name, image, price, and rating. It is designed to be displayed in a grid format, with multiple cards arranged side-by-side. The component helps users assess the product's suitability and make informed purchasing decisions. It typically follows a consistent visual language and responsive design principles to ensure optimal viewing across devices.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for interactive elements

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- BEM methodology
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

HTML and CSS Basics

Through this exercise, I learned how to correctly build the structure of a website using HTML semantics. Additionally, I gained an understanding of how to design a website with CSS using the BEM methodology, resulting in clean, reusable, and easy-to-maintain code.

### Continued development

I want to continue learning the basics of HTML and CSS until I fully master all their concepts. Then, I want to focus on Javascript to understand its foundations and be able to move forward with its libraries and frameworks, thereby mastering the frontend development area.

### Useful resources

- [Resource 1](https://blog.soyhenry.com/que-son-los-encabezados-en-html/#:~:text=Los%20encabezados) - This helped me to understand how to correctly use headings in HTML.
- [Resource 2](https://blog.ida.cl/desarrollo/metodologia-bem-desarrollo-front-end/#:~:text=BEM%20) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand BEM methodology. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward.
